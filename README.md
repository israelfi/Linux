# Purpose

I've created this git repository in order to organize my studies with shell commands. 

# Content

In here, you'll find different shell commands that I thought that may be useful. I tried to organize them under labels:

- **bash_enviroment.txt** Mainly about shell and enviroment variables
- **file_management.txt** I think this name explains pretty well what you will find in here
- **util.txt** Random commands that I think that are interesting 

Feel free to use them as you want.

# Sources

One of the sources that I used is the [Enki App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.enki.insights&hl).
